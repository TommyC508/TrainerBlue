Week 1

This week the project has made some okay progress towards
creating the right environment for the agent to train in.
After last weeks progress, I noticed how Copilot basically
made its own oversimplified version of pokemon gym to train
the agent and was not very viable for my vision. I tried to
improve the environment to something as close as I could get
to the real showdown but found it way easier just to clone the
whole showdown repository. I am encountering multiple issues
with the implementation of the showdown battle simulation
into a gym for training.
