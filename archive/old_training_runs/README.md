# Archived Training Results (Pre-Battle System Revamp)

**Archive Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Reason:** Battle system revamped with Pokemon Showdown-accurate mechanics

---

## What's Here

This directory contains training results and documentation from Phases 3 and 4 **before** the battle system revamp (Phase 2.5). These results are no longer representative of the current system's capabilities.

## Archived Files

1. **PHASE3_COMPLETION.md** - Phase 3 training results (0% win rate)
2. **PHASE3_PROGRESS.md** - Phase 3 progress tracking
3. **PHASE4_COMPLETION.md** - Phase 4 training results (100% win rate)
4. **PHASE4_PROGRESS.md** - Phase 4 progress tracking
5. **PHASE4_FINAL_SUMMARY.txt** - Phase 4 summary report
6. **PHASE4_SUMMARY.md** - Phase 4 initiation summary

## Why Archived?

### Original System Issues (Pre-Revamp)
- Generic Pokemon without real species/stats
- Missing secondary move effects
- Inaccurate damage calculations
- Simplified battle mechanics
- Results not representative of real Pokemon battles

### Battle System Revamp (Phase 2.5)
The battle system was completely overhauled to match Pokemon Showdown accuracy:
- ✅ Real Pokemon species with accurate stats
- ✅ Full move database with secondary effects
- ✅ Gen 9 damage calculator
- ✅ Status conditions and stat modifications
- ✅ Type effectiveness and STAB
- ✅ Speed-based turn order
- ✅ Weather and field effects

### Impact on Training Results
- Old training results (100% win rate) were achieved on a simplified, less accurate system
- New training runs will be more challenging but more meaningful
- Performance metrics will better reflect real competitive Pokemon battles

## Current Status

Training has been reset for both Phase 3 and Phase 4:
- **Logs cleared:** All TensorBoard events and evaluation data removed
- **Models removed:** All checkpoints and saved models deleted
- **Documentation reset:** Fresh progress trackers created
- **Ready for retraining:** Clean slate with improved battle system

See the main `/docs` folder for current training progress with the revamped system.

## Historical Note

Despite the limitations, these training runs were valuable for:
- Establishing the RL training pipeline
- Testing Stable-Baselines3 integration
- Validating the training infrastructure
- Learning what metrics to track
- Identifying the need for battle system improvements

The experience gained from these runs directly led to the battle system revamp and will guide future training efforts.
